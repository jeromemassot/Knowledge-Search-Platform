# Seattle Children's Hospital Knowledge Search Platform

## Project Overview

This project is a knowledge search platform designed for the Seattle Children's Hospital. It scrapes medical information from the hospital's website, enriches it using Google's Gemini AI, and presents it as an interactive knowledge graph.

The primary goal is to provide a tool for researchers, doctors, and patients to easily explore and understand the relationships between different medical conditions, treatments, and resources.

**Core Technologies:**

*   **Backend (Data Processing & Enrichment):**
    *   **Python:** The core language for data scraping, processing, and interacting with the Gemini API.
    *   **Jupyter Notebooks:** Used for interactive development and execution of the data pipeline.
    *   **Google Gemini API:** Leveraged for content summarization and keyword extraction to enrich the scraped data.
    *   **Beautiful Soup & requests:** For web scraping the Seattle Children's Hospital website.
    *   **Pydantic:** For data validation and modeling.

*   **Frontend (Visualization):**
    *   **React:** The JavaScript library for building the user interface.
    *   **TypeScript:** For type-safe JavaScript development.
    *   **Vite:** A fast build tool for modern web development.
    *   **react-force-graph-2d:** A React component for rendering interactive 2D force-directed graphs.

**Architecture:**

The project follows a two-stage architecture:

1.  **Data Pipeline (Backend):**
    *   Jupyter notebooks in the `/notebooks` directory are used to scrape raw data from the Seattle Children's Hospital website.
    *   The scraped HTML content is converted to Markdown.
    *   The Gemini API is then used to process this content, generating concise summaries and extracting relevant keywords for each medical condition page.
    *   The enriched data is stored in JSONL format in the `/data` directory.

2.  **Visualization (Frontend):**
    *   A React application in the `/app` directory consumes the processed JSONL data.
    *   It uses `react-force-graph-2d` to render an interactive knowledge graph, where nodes represent pages, chunks of information, and related links, and the edges represent the relationships between them.
    *   Users can explore the graph, click on nodes to see detailed information (including the AI-generated summaries and keywords), and filter the displayed information.

## Building and Running

### Backend (Data Processing)

The backend data processing pipeline is managed through Jupyter Notebooks.

**1. Dependencies:**

Install the required Python packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**2. Running the Notebooks:**

The primary notebooks for the data pipeline are located in the `/notebooks` directory:

*   `Seattle Children Hospital KMS.ipynb`: This notebook handles the initial web scraping of the Seattle Children's Hospital website to gather the raw content.
*   `Seattle Children Hospital Conditions GraphRAG.ipynb`: This notebook takes the scraped data, uses the Gemini API to generate summaries and keywords, and structures the data for the frontend application.

To run the pipeline, execute the cells in these notebooks in order. You will need to have a Jupyter environment set up.

### Frontend (Visualization)

The frontend is a standalone React application.

**1. Prerequisites:**

*   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your system.

**2. Setup and Running:**

Navigate to the `app` directory and run the following commands:

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run the development server
npm run dev
```

This will start the Vite development server, and the application will be accessible at `http://localhost:5173` (or the next available port).

## Development Conventions

*   **Backend:** The backend code is written in Python within Jupyter Notebooks. It makes use of type hints and Pydantic models for data integrity.
*   **Frontend:** The frontend is built with React and TypeScript, following modern functional component and hooks-based patterns.
*   **Styling:** The application uses Tailwind CSS for styling, as indicated by the `tailwind.config.js` and the class names used in the components.
*   **Data Flow:** The frontend loads data from the static JSONL files generated by the backend. There is no direct API connection between the frontend and the Python backend in the current architecture.
*   **State Management:** Component-level state is managed using React hooks (`useState`, `useCallback`, etc.).
