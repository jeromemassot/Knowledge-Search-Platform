       "'# 22q11.2-Related Disorders\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n## What are 22q11\\\\.2\\\\-related disorders?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n22q11\\\\.2\\\\-related disorders are caused by differences in part of chromosome 22, called the q11\\\\.2 region. Chromosomes contain genes, which tell our cells how to work and what proteins to make. There are 23 pairs of chromosomes in each cell of the body.\\n\\n\\n22q11\\\\.2\\\\-related disorders happen in at least 1 in 1,000 newborns.\\n\\n\\nThe symptoms differ widely, even among members of the same family. There may be small differences in how your child’s eyelids, nose and ears look.\\n\\n\\nThese conditions are linked to many health issues. They can affect your child’s growth, feeding, breathing, speaking, hearing, learning and mental health. But most children with 22q11\\\\.2\\\\-related disorders only have problems in some of these areas.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n### What causes 22q11\\\\.2\\\\-related disorders?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThese disorders happen because of changes in the 22q11\\\\.2 part of chromosome 22\\\\. There may be extra genes, missing genes or genes in the wrong place.\\n\\n\\nYour child may:\\n\\n\\n* Be **missing** a small part of chromosome 22 (22q11\\\\.2 deletion syndrome).\\n* Have **extra** genes in the q11\\\\.2 part of chromosome 22 (22q11\\\\.2 duplication syndrome).\\n* Have changes\\xa0**near**\\xa0the q11\\\\.2 part of chromosome 22 (22q11\\\\.2 distal deletion disorder).\\n* Have genes from 22q11\\\\.2 switch places with genes on another chromosome (translocation).\\n* Have a 22q11\\\\.2\\\\-related disorder\\xa0**and**\\xa0another genetic syndrome.\\n\\n\\nWhether the genetic change is new or inherited varies:\\n\\n\\n* For 90% of children with 22q11\\\\.2 **deletion**, this is a new genetic change (not passed down from a parent).\\n* In 66% of children with 22q11\\\\.2 **duplication**, the genetic change is passed from a parent.\\n\\n\\nWhen people with 22q11\\\\.2 related disorders become parents, they have a 50% chance of passing the condition to their child.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other names for 22q11\\\\.2\\\\-related disorders\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThere are many older names for these conditions. These names were used before it was known that all are a form of the same condition.\\n\\n\\nAll of these names have been replaced with “22q11\\\\.2\\\\-related disorders:”\\n\\n\\n* Velocardiofacial syndrome (VCFS)\\n* DiGeorge syndrome\\n* Shprintzen syndrome\\n* Conotruncal anomaly unusual face syndrome\\n* Cayler cardiofacial syndrome\\n* Catch 22 syndrome\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\n[22q11\\\\.2\\\\-Related Disorders Care at Seattle Children\\'s](/clinics/craniofacial/services/22q-clinic/)\\n\\n\\nAt the 22q Clinic, a team experienced with these conditions will evaluate your child. We create a personalized care plan for your child and bring in other experts to meet your child’s specific needs.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\n## Symptoms of 22q11\\\\.2\\\\-Related Disorders\\n\\n\\nEvery child with a 22q11\\\\.2\\\\-related disorder is different.\\n\\n\\nSome children have facial differences, including:\\n\\n\\n* Eyelids that look hooded\\n* A nose that is tube\\\\-shaped\\n* Ears that are folded over more than normal at the edges\\n* A face that looks long, with flat cheeks\\n* A narrow mouth\\n\\n\\nThe 22q11\\\\.2\\\\-related disorders may cause problems with your child’s:\\n\\n\\n* Roof of the mouth (palate), including\\xa0[cleft palate](/conditions/cleft-lip-palate/ \"cleft palate\")\\n* Ears, nose or throat\\n* Heart\\n* Infection\\\\-fighting immune system\\n* Nervous system\\n* Kidneys\\n* Skeleton\\n* Hormone\\\\-producing endocrine system\\n\\n\\nThese differences may affect your child’s growth, feeding, breathing, speaking, hearing, learning or mental health.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n## Diagnosing 22q11\\\\.2\\\\-Related Disorders\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSeattle Children’s has a [22q Clinic](/clinics/craniofacial/services/22q-clinic/ \"22q Clinic\") focused on diagnosing these conditions and helping families manage them.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n### Diagnosis before birth\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThese conditions are sometimes diagnosed before birth. The tests use different samples:\\n\\n\\n* An expectant mother’s blood, which includes DNA from the placenta. Noninvasive prenatal screening (NIPS) can identify some conditions. But many mothers whose test shows a risk of 22q11\\\\.2 conditions will go on to have a healthy child. Further testing is needed to confirm the diagnosis.\\n* Amniotic fluid that surrounds and protects a baby in the womb (amniocentesis).\\n* Part of the placenta, through a test called chorionic villus sampling (CVS).\\n\\n\\nFurther tests on CVS or amniotic fluid samples may detect the specific 22q11\\\\.2 disorder. The 2 tests are FISH and chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA). Genetic testing may include doing a karyotype to make sure parts of the chromosomes have not switched places with one another.\\n\\n\\nThe tests can show if your baby has missing, extra or misplaced genes in the q11\\\\.2 area of chromosome 22\\\\. But they can not tell how much these genetic changes will affect your baby.\\n\\n\\nTo look for specific problems, your child may have a detailed ultrasound or fetal heart scan ([fetal echo](/clinics/heart/treatments-and-services/echocardiography/ \"fetal echo\")).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n### Diagnosis after birth\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nYour doctor will check your child and look for the differences that are linked with 22q11\\\\.2\\\\-related disorders. Since the symptoms of the conditions differ from child to child, a careful exam is important.\\n\\n\\nYour doctor may recommend genetic tests to tell the type of 22q11\\\\.2 disorder your child has.\\n\\n\\nDoctors may order other tests or procedures to learn more about your child’s exact condition. For example, an ultrasound picture of their heart (echocardiogram) can show if they have any heart problems.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n### Genetic counseling and testing\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPhysicians and genetic counselors at our 22q Clinic will talk with you about the pros and cons of genetic testing and explain test results.\\n\\n\\nOur counselors also can give you information about your child’s condition. Counseling can help you make informed decisions about family planning and your child’s treatment.\\n\\n\\nOur genetic counselors also advise people with 22q11\\\\.2\\\\-related disorders about their chance of having a child with a similar condition. A person with the condition has a 50% chance in each pregnancy of passing it on to their child.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n## Treating 22q11\\\\.2\\\\-Related Disorders\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe effects of these conditions vary greatly from child to child. We create a personalized care plan based on your child\\'s specific needs.\\n\\n\\nBecause of the high rates of problems in the following areas, most children with 22q11\\\\.2\\\\-related disorders will need to see providers with special training in:\\n\\n\\n* [Audiology](/clinics/audiology/ \"Audiology\")\\n* [Genetic counseling](/clinics/genetics/genetic-counseling/ \"Genetic counseling\")\\n* [Neuropsychology](/clinics/neuropsychology/)\\n* [Immunology](/clinics/immunology/)\\n* [Nutrition](/clinics/nutrition/ \"Nutrition\")\\n* [Occupational Therapy](/clinics/occupational-therapy/)\\n* [Otolaryngology](/clinics/otolaryngology/ \"Otolaryngology\")\\n* [Psychiatry/Psychology](/clinics/psychiatry-and-behavioral-medicine/ \"Psychiatry\")\\n* [Social work](/clinics/social-work/ \"Social work\")\\n* [Speech and language pathology](/clinics/speech-and-language/ \"Speech and language pathology\")\\n\\n\\nThese providers are all part of our coordinated 22q Team Clinic.\\n\\n\\nDepending on their medical problems and test results, your child may also need to see other specialists at Seattle Children’s.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n### Feeding and growth\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChildren with 22q11\\\\.2\\\\-related disorders may have a hard time feeding. This can be caused by problems with their mouth or throat:\\n\\n\\n* Not having enough tissue (“insufficient”) in the palate or throat ([velopharyngeal insufficiency](/conditions/vpd/ \"velopharyngeal insufficiency\"), VPI)\\n* A gap in the roof of the mouth ([cleft palate](/conditions/cleft-lip-palate/ \"cleft palate\"))\\n* A gap in the roof of the mouth that is covered by the lining of the mouth (submucous cleft palate)\\n\\n\\nOur [Feeding Management](/clinics/craniofacial/services/feeding-management/ \"Feeding Management\") team can help. A dietitian may advise you about your child\\'s diet.\\n\\n\\n* We can teach you ways to [feed your baby](/clinics/craniofacial/patient-family-resources/cleft-feeding-instructions/ \"feed your baby\") and recommend special bottles to use.\\n* If your baby is not able to get enough nutrition by bottle, they may need a tube from their nose to their stomach (NG tube). For most children, this is temporary and they are able to go back to feeding entirely by mouth after feeding therapy.\\n* If feeding problems are severe, your doctor may recommend placing a tube through your child’s belly (abdominal wall) into the stomach. This is called a gastrostomy tube or G\\\\-tube.\\n\\n\\n#### Palate repair\\n\\n\\nIf your child has problems with the roof of their mouth or throat, your surgeon will talk with you about repair.\\n\\n\\n* Repairing a gap in the roof of the mouth (cleft palate) usually happens when your child is about 1 year old. See [Cleft Palate Treatments](/conditions/cleft-lip-palate/#treating \"Cleft Palate Treatments\").\\n* Other problems with the mouth or throat, such as [velopharyngeal dysfunction](/conditions/vpd/ \"velopharyngeal dysfunction\") (VPD), are treated when your child is older than 1 year.\\n\\n\\n#### Growth\\n\\n\\nWe will check regularly to make sure your child is growing well.\\n\\n\\n* Children with 22q11\\\\.2 **deletion** syndrome often have a different and slower pattern of growth than other children. We compare your child to growth charts specific to 22q11\\\\.2 deletion syndrome.\\n* Usually, children with 22q11\\\\.2 **duplication**\\xa0are bigger than average.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n### Hearing\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nYour doctor will check your child\\'s ear health and hearing regularly.\\n\\n\\n* Most often your baby’s hearing is tested soon after birth or within a few days.\\n* If there are concerns, we do more tests. A specialist trained to test hearing in babies and children (audiologist) will do the testing.\\n* Some children have hearing loss. It may be caused by fluid behind the eardrums or by problems with the nerve pathways from the inner ear to the brain. The treatments for these types of hearing loss are different.\\n* Your doctor will determine if your child has hearing loss and will talk with you about treatment.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n### Speech\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIn some children, differences in the mouth or throat cause problems with speech.\\n\\n\\nBy age 2, a speech and language pathologist (SLP) will regularly check your child’s ability to make speech sounds. Our team will continue to check your child’s speech as they grow.\\n\\n\\nSome children have a condition called [velopharyngeal dysfunction](/conditions/vpd/ \"velopharyngeal dysfunction\") (VPD), which makes it hard for them to make speech sounds correctly. VPD may develop over time in a child who had a cleft palate repaired.\\n\\n\\nDepending on your child’s needs, we may recommend:\\n\\n\\n* A custom\\\\-made speech appliance called an obturator.\\n* Surgery on the roof of the mouth or throat. Your surgeon and speech pathologist will work together to recommend what is best for your child.\\n* Speech therapy to develop correct speech sounds.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n### Heart\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nProblems in the heart are common in children with 22q11\\\\.2\\\\-related disorders. The problem could be mild, like an unusual sound heard during a heartbeat (heart murmur). Sometimes it is serious enough to affect how the heart works.\\n\\n\\nIf your child is healthy and growing well, it is not likely that they have a major heart problem. To check, your child’s doctor will order an ultrasound picture of your child’s heart (echocardiogram).\\n\\n\\nIf problems are found, your child will see a heart specialist (cardiologist) for care as needed. [Learn more about Children’s Heart Center](/clinics/heart/why-choose-us/ \"Learn more about Children’s Heart Center\").\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n### Immune system\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMany children with 22q11\\\\.2\\\\-related disorders have problems with their immune system, which helps protect their body from sickness.\\n\\n\\nWe will check the number of infection\\\\-fighting white cells in your child’s blood. We may send your child to a doctor who specializes in the immune system (immunologist).\\n\\n\\nIf your child’s immune system does not work well, they may:\\n\\n\\n* Be more likely to get infections. We will watch for signs of an infection and treat it quickly. Rarely, children need to take antibiotics or other treatments to prevent infection.\\n* Need extra doses of vaccines to build enough protection against disease.\\n* Need to avoid some vaccines with live viruses because their body is less able to fight infection.\\n\\n\\n[Learn more about Children’s Immunology program](/clinics/immunology/ \"Learn more about Children’s Immunology program\").\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n### Kidneys\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSome children with 22q11\\\\.2\\\\-related disorders have kidney problems. We may recommend that your child have a kidney (renal) ultrasound.\\n\\n\\nWe are looking to make sure that the kidneys formed normally. If your child has a normal ultrasound, they will not need another one.\\n\\n\\nIf there is a problem, your child will see a kidney specialist (nephrologist).\\n\\n\\n[Learn more about Children’s Nephrology program](/clinics/nephrology/ \"Learn more about Children’s Nephrology program\").\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n### Low calcium levels in blood\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSome children with 22q\\\\-related disorders have problems with low calcium levels. If calcium is too low it can cause seizures.\\n\\n\\nWe will do a blood test to check the calcium level. Your doctor may decide your child needs to take a calcium supplement or see an [endocrinologist](/clinics/endocrinology/).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n### Development and learning\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMany children with 22q11\\\\.2\\\\-related disorders have differences in how they learn and process information. Some children will have normal intelligence, and some will have intelligence that is below normal.\\n\\n\\nYour child’s care team will make sure their learning style is tested. This helps us better understand how they process information. We will help your child’s school know the best ways to support your child’s learning.\\n\\n\\nSome children with 22q11\\\\.2\\\\-related disorders will have trouble learning because of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), anxiety or autism spectrum disorder. If your child develops any of these problems, a specialist will evaluate your child and suggest treatment to help them start school ready to learn. We will also work with you to find resources in your community if needed.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n### Behavior and mental health\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n22q11\\\\.2\\\\-related disorders increase the risk of problems with behavior and mental health. These include:\\n\\n\\n* Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)\\n* Autism spectrum disorder\\n* Anxiety\\n* Depression\\n* Bipolar disorder\\n\\n\\nMany problems can be managed well if they are found early and treated by a doctor familiar with 22q11\\\\.2\\\\-related disorders.\\n\\n\\n* Patients with 22q\\\\-related disorders have an increased risk of autism spectrum disorder and other problems affecting the brain and central nervous system (neurodevelopmental).\\n* Children with 22q\\\\-related disorders are also at risk for other psychiatric conditions, such as schizophrenia \\xa0and anxiety.\\n\\n\\nVarious types of mental health issues begin at different times. We will regularly check your child’s behavior, mood and coping. Your healthcare team will ask about your child’s behavior at home and school.\\n\\n\\nIf there are concerns, a psychiatrist or neurodevelopmental specialist will evaluate your child and recommend treatment. Your craniofacial pediatrician and social worker will work with you to find resources in your community if needed.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n## 22q11\\\\.2\\\\-Related Disorders at Seattle Children\\'s\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMany families have never heard of these conditions before their child’s diagnosis. Seattle Children’s has a [clinic](/clinics/craniofacial/services/22q-clinic/ \"clinic\") focused on caring for children with 22q11\\\\.2\\\\-related disorders.\\n\\n\\nMany of the babies and children we see are newly diagnosed.

       " 'content': '# 22q11.2-Related Disorders\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n## What are 22q11\\\\.2\\\\-related disorders?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n22q11\\\\.2\\\\-related disorders are caused by differences in part of chromosome 22, called the q11\\\\.2 region. Chromosomes contain genes, which tell our cells how to work and what proteins to make. There are 23 pairs of chromosomes in each cell of the body.\\n\\n\\n22q11\\\\.2\\\\-related disorders happen in at least 1 in 1,000 newborns.\\n\\n\\nThe symptoms differ widely, even among members of the same family. There may be small differences in how your child’s eyelids, nose and ears look.\\n\\n\\nThese conditions are linked to many health issues. They can affect your child’s growth, feeding, breathing, speaking, hearing, learning and mental health. But most children with 22q11\\\\.2\\\\-related disorders only have problems in some of these areas.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n### What causes 22q11\\\\.2\\\\-related disorders?\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThese disorders happen because of changes in the 22q11\\\\.2 part of chromosome 22\\\\. There may be extra genes, missing genes or genes in the wrong place.\\n\\n\\nYour child may:\\n\\n\\n* Be **missing** a small part of chromosome 22 (22q11\\\\.2 deletion syndrome).\\n* Have **extra** genes in the q11\\\\.2 part of chromosome 22 (22q11\\\\.2 duplication syndrome).\\n* Have changes\\xa0**near**\\xa0the q11\\\\.2 part of chromosome 22 (22q11\\\\.2 distal deletion disorder).\\n* Have genes from 22q11\\\\.2 switch places with genes on another chromosome (translocation).\\n* Have a 22q11\\\\.2\\\\-related disorder\\xa0**and**\\xa0another genetic syndrome.\\n\\n\\nWhether the genetic change is new or inherited varies:\\n\\n\\n* For 90% of children with 22q11\\\\.2 **deletion**, this is a new genetic change (not passed down from a parent).\\n* In 66% of children with 22q11\\\\.2 **duplication**, the genetic change is passed from a parent.\\n\\n\\nWhen people with 22q11\\\\.2 related disorders become parents, they have a 50% chance of passing the condition to their child.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n### Other names for 22q11\\\\.2\\\\-related disorders\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThere are many older names for these conditions. These names were used before it was known that all are a form of the same condition.\\n\\n\\nAll of these names have been replaced with “22q11\\\\.2\\\\-related disorders:”\\n\\n\\n* Velocardiofacial syndrome (VCFS)\\n* DiGeorge syndrome\\n* Shprintzen syndrome\\n* Conotruncal anomaly unusual face syndrome\\n* Cayler cardiofacial syndrome\\n* Catch 22 syndrome\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\n[22q11\\\\.2\\\\-Related Disorders Care at Seattle Children\\'s](/clinics/craniofacial/services/22q-clinic/)\\n\\n\\nAt the 22q Clinic, a team experienced with these conditions will evaluate your child. We create a personalized care plan for your child and bring in other experts to meet your child’s specific needs.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\n## Symptoms of 22q11\\\\.2\\\\-Related Disorders\\n\\n\\nEvery child with a 22q11\\\\.2\\\\-related disorder is different.\\n\\n\\nSome children have facial differences, including:\\n\\n\\n* Eyelids that look hooded\\n* A nose that is tube\\\\-shaped\\n* Ears that are folded over more than normal at the edges\\n* A face that looks long, with flat cheeks\\n* A narrow mouth\\n\\n\\nThe 22q11\\\\.2\\\\-related disorders may cause problems with your child’s:\\n\\n\\n* Roof of the mouth (palate), including\\xa0[cleft palate](/conditions/cleft-lip-palate/ \"cleft palate\")\\n* Ears, nose or throat\\n* Heart\\n* Infection\\\\-fighting immune system\\n* Nervous system\\n* Kidneys\\n* Skeleton\\n* Hormone\\\\-producing endocrine system\\n\\n\\nThese differences may affect your child’s growth, feeding, breathing, speaking, hearing, learning or mental health.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n## Diagnosing 22q11\\\\.2\\\\-Related Disorders\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSeattle Children’s has a [22q Clinic](/clinics/craniofacial/services/22q-clinic/ \"22q Clinic\") focused on diagnosing these conditions and helping families manage them.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n### Diagnosis before birth\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThese conditions are sometimes diagnosed before birth. The tests use different samples:\\n\\n\\n* An expectant mother’s blood, which includes DNA from the placenta. Noninvasive prenatal screening (NIPS) can identify some conditions. But many mothers whose test shows a risk of 22q11\\\\.2 conditions will go on to have a healthy child. Further testing is needed to confirm the diagnosis.\\n* Amniotic fluid that surrounds and protects a baby in the womb (amniocentesis).\\n* Part of the placenta, through a test called chorionic villus sampling (CVS).\\n\\n\\nFurther tests on CVS or amniotic fluid samples may detect the specific 22q11\\\\.2 disorder. The 2 tests are FISH and chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA). Genetic testing may include doing a karyotype to make sure parts of the chromosomes have not switched places with one another.\\n\\n\\nThe tests can show if your baby has missing, extra or misplaced genes in the q11\\\\.2 area of chromosome 22\\\\. But they can not tell how much these genetic changes will affect your baby.\\n\\n\\nTo look for specific problems, your child may have a detailed ultrasound or fetal heart scan ([fetal echo](/clinics/heart/treatments-and-services/echocardiography/ \"fetal echo\")).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n### Diagnosis after birth\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nYour doctor will check your child and look for the differences that are linked with 22q11\\\\.2\\\\-related disorders. Since the symptoms of the conditions differ from child to child, a careful exam is important.\\n\\n\\nYour doctor may recommend genetic tests to tell the type of 22q11\\\\.2 disorder your child has.\\n\\n\\nDoctors may order other tests or procedures to learn more about your child’s exact condition. For example, an ultrasound picture of their heart (echocardiogram) can show if they have any heart problems.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n### Genetic counseling and testing\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nPhysicians and genetic counselors at our 22q Clinic will talk with you about the pros and cons of genetic testing and explain test results.\\n\\n\\nOur counselors also can give you information about your child’s condition. Counseling can help you make informed decisions about family planning and your child’s treatment.\\n\\n\\nOur genetic counselors also advise people with 22q11\\\\.2\\\\-related disorders about their chance of having a child with a similar condition. A person with the condition has a 50% chance in each pregnancy of passing it on to their child.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n## Treating 22q11\\\\.2\\\\-Related Disorders\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nThe effects of these conditions vary greatly from child to child. We create a personalized care plan based on your child\\'s specific needs.\\n\\n\\nBecause of the high rates of problems in the following areas, most children with 22q11\\\\.2\\\\-related disorders will need to see providers with special training in:\\n\\n\\n* [Audiology](/clinics/audiology/ \"Audiology\")\\n* [Genetic counseling](/clinics/genetics/genetic-counseling/ \"Genetic counseling\")\\n* [Neuropsychology](/clinics/neuropsychology/)\\n* [Immunology](/clinics/immunology/)\\n* [Nutrition](/clinics/nutrition/ \"Nutrition\")\\n* [Occupational Therapy](/clinics/occupational-therapy/)\\n* [Otolaryngology](/clinics/otolaryngology/ \"Otolaryngology\")\\n* [Psychiatry/Psychology](/clinics/psychiatry-and-behavioral-medicine/ \"Psychiatry\")\\n* [Social work](/clinics/social-work/ \"Social work\")\\n* [Speech and language pathology](/clinics/speech-and-language/ \"Speech and language pathology\")\\n\\n\\nThese providers are all part of our coordinated 22q Team Clinic.\\n\\n\\nDepending on their medical problems and test results, your child may also need to see other specialists at Seattle Children’s.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n### Feeding and growth\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nChildren with 22q11\\\\.2\\\\-related disorders may have a hard time feeding. This can be caused by problems with their mouth or throat:\\n\\n\\n* Not having enough tissue (“insufficient”) in the palate or throat ([velopharyngeal insufficiency](/conditions/vpd/ \"velopharyngeal insufficiency\"), VPI)\\n* A gap in the roof of the mouth ([cleft palate](/conditions/cleft-lip-palate/ \"cleft palate\"))\\n* A gap in the roof of the mouth that is covered by the lining of the mouth (submucous cleft palate)\\n\\n\\nOur [Feeding Management](/clinics/craniofacial/services/feeding-management/ \"Feeding Management\") team can help. A dietitian may advise you about your child\\'s diet.\\n\\n\\n* We can teach you ways to [feed your baby](/clinics/craniofacial/patient-family-resources/cleft-feeding-instructions/ \"feed your baby\") and recommend special bottles to use.\\n* If your baby is not able to get enough nutrition by bottle, they may need a tube from their nose to their stomach (NG tube). For most children, this is temporary and they are able to go back to feeding entirely by mouth after feeding therapy.\\n* If feeding problems are severe, your doctor may recommend placing a tube through your child’s belly (abdominal wall) into the stomach. This is called a gastrostomy tube or G\\\\-tube.\\n\\n\\n#### Palate repair\\n\\n\\nIf your child has problems with the roof of their mouth or throat, your surgeon will talk with you about repair.\\n\\n\\n* Repairing a gap in the roof of the mouth (cleft palate) usually happens when your child is about 1 year old. See [Cleft Palate Treatments](/conditions/cleft-lip-palate/#treating \"Cleft Palate Treatments\").\\n* Other problems with the mouth or throat, such as [velopharyngeal dysfunction](/conditions/vpd/ \"velopharyngeal dysfunction\") (VPD), are treated when your child is older than 1 year.\\n\\n\\n#### Growth\\n\\n\\nWe will check regularly to make sure your child is growing well.\\n\\n\\n* Children with 22q11\\\\.2 **deletion** syndrome often have a different and slower pattern of growth than other children. We compare your child to growth charts specific to 22q11\\\\.2 deletion syndrome.\\n* Usually, children with 22q11\\\\.2 **duplication**\\xa0are bigger than average.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n### Hearing\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nYour doctor will check your child\\'s ear health and hearing regularly.\\n\\n\\n* Most often your baby’s hearing is tested soon after birth or within a few days.\\n* If there are concerns, we do more tests. A specialist trained to test hearing in babies and children (audiologist) will do the testing.\\n* Some children have hearing loss. It may be caused by fluid behind the eardrums or by problems with the nerve pathways from the inner ear to the brain. The treatments for these types of hearing loss are different.\\n* Your doctor will determine if your child has hearing loss and will talk with you about treatment.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n### Speech\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIn some children, differences in the mouth or throat cause problems with speech.\\n\\n\\nBy age 2, a speech and language pathologist (SLP) will regularly check your child’s ability to make speech sounds. Our team will continue to check your child’s speech as they grow.\\n\\n\\nSome children have a condition called [velopharyngeal dysfunction](/conditions/vpd/ \"velopharyngeal dysfunction\") (VPD), which makes it hard for them to make speech sounds correctly. VPD may develop over time in a child who had a cleft palate repaired.\\n\\n\\nDepending on your child’s needs, we may recommend:\\n\\n\\n* A custom\\\\-made speech appliance called an obturator.\\n* Surgery on the roof of the mouth or throat. Your surgeon and speech pathologist will work together to recommend what is best for your child.\\n* Speech therapy to develop correct speech sounds.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n### Heart\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nProblems in the heart are common in children with 22q11\\\\.2\\\\-related disorders. The problem could be mild, like an unusual sound heard during a heartbeat (heart murmur). Sometimes it is serious enough to affect how the heart works.\\n\\n\\nIf your child is healthy and growing well, it is not likely that they have a major heart problem. To check, your child’s doctor will order an ultrasound picture of your child’s heart (echocardiogram).\\n\\n\\nIf problems are found, your child will see a heart specialist (cardiologist) for care as needed. [Learn more about Children’s Heart Center](/clinics/heart/why-choose-us/ \"Learn more about Children’s Heart Center\").\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n### Immune system\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMany children with 22q11\\\\.2\\\\-related disorders have problems with their immune system, which helps protect their body from sickness.\\n\\n\\nWe will check the number of infection\\\\-fighting white cells in your child’s blood. We may send your child to a doctor who specializes in the immune system (immunologist).\\n\\n\\nIf your child’s immune system does not work well, they may:\\n\\n\\n* Be more likely to get infections. We will watch for signs of an infection and treat it quickly. Rarely, children need to take antibiotics or other treatments to prevent infection.\\n* Need extra doses of vaccines to build enough protection against disease.\\n* Need to avoid some vaccines with live viruses because their body is less able to fight infection.\\n\\n\\n[Learn more about Children’s Immunology program](/clinics/immunology/ \"Learn more about Children’s Immunology program\").\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n### Kidneys\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSome children with 22q11\\\\.2\\\\-related disorders have kidney problems. We may recommend that your child have a kidney (renal) ultrasound.\\n\\n\\nWe are looking to make sure that the kidneys formed normally. If your child has a normal ultrasound, they will not need another one.\\n\\n\\nIf there is a problem, your child will see a kidney specialist (nephrologist).\\n\\n\\n[Learn more about Children’s Nephrology program](/clinics/nephrology/ \"Learn more about Children’s Nephrology program\").\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n### Low calcium levels in blood\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSome children with 22q\\\\-related disorders have problems with low calcium levels. If calcium is too low it can cause seizures.\\n\\n\\nWe will do a blood test to check the calcium level. Your doctor may decide your child needs to take a calcium supplement or see an [endocrinologist](/clinics/endocrinology/).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n### Development and learning\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMany children with 22q11\\\\.2\\\\-related disorders have differences in how they learn and process information. Some children will have normal intelligence, and some will have intelligence that is below normal.\\n\\n\\nYour child’s care team will make sure their learning style is tested. This helps us better understand how they process information. We will help your child’s school know the best ways to support your child’s learning.\\n\\n\\nSome children with 22q11\\\\.2\\\\-related disorders will have trouble learning because of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), anxiety or autism spectrum disorder. If your child develops any of these problems, a specialist will evaluate your child and suggest treatment to help them start school ready to learn. We will also work with you to find resources in your community if needed.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n### Behavior and mental health\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n22q11\\\\.2\\\\-related disorders increase the risk of problems with behavior and mental health. These include:\\n\\n\\n* Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)\\n* Autism spectrum disorder\\n* Anxiety\\n* Depression\\n* Bipolar disorder\\n\\n\\nMany problems can be managed well if they are found early and treated by a doctor familiar with 22q11\\\\.2\\\\-related disorders.\\n\\n\\n* Patients with 22q\\\\-related disorders have an increased risk of autism spectrum disorder and other problems affecting the brain and central nervous system (neurodevelopmental).\\n* Children with 22q\\\\-related disorders are also at risk for other psychiatric conditions, such as schizophrenia \\xa0and anxiety.\\n\\n\\nVarious types of mental health issues begin at different times. We will regularly check your child’s behavior, mood and coping. Your healthcare team will ask about your child’s behavior at home and school.\\n\\n\\nIf there are concerns, a psychiatrist or neurodevelopmental specialist will evaluate your child and recommend treatment. Your craniofacial pediatrician and social worker will work with you to find resources in your community if needed.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n## 22q11\\\\.2\\\\-Related Disorders at Seattle Children\\'s\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nMany families have never heard of these conditions before their child’s diagnosis.
